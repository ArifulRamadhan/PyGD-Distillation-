PyGD: Open-Source Distillation Module

PyGD is a Python-based open-source module for binary distillation calculations using McCabe-Thiele and Ponchon-Savarit methods. It automates graphical distillation analysis, reducing manual calculation errors by leveraging NumPy and Matplotlib. Tested on acetone-acetic acid separation at 70Â°C, 1 atm, PyGD provides accurate McCabe-Thiele results but has deviations in Ponchon-Savarit compared to Aspen HYSYS.

Features:
Automated McCabe-Thiele & Ponchon-Savarit calculations
Open-source and easy to use
Visualizations with Matplotlib

Keywords: Python, Open-source, Distillation, Separation, McCabe-Thiele.
